# Bug Fixes & Technical Issues

Critical bugs and technical issues that need immediate attention.

## üö® Critical Bugs

### TypeScript Compilation Errors

- [ ] **chokidar namespace error** in `src/app/api/files/watch/route.ts`
  - Error: Cannot find namespace 'chokidar'
  - Impact: File watching functionality breaks
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **Store type inconsistencies** in task management
  - Error: Property mismatches between TaskGroup interfaces
  - Impact: Type safety compromised
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **Missing properties in DocsStore**
  - Error: Properties 'doc' and 'fetchDoc' missing
  - Impact: Documentation pages fail to load
  - Priority: High

### Runtime Errors

- [ ] **Port conflicts** in CLI testing
  - Issue: Default port 3000 often in use during development
  - Impact: CLI testing fails
  - Solution: Use dynamic port assignment

- [ ] **File watcher memory leaks**
  - Issue: EventSource connections not properly closed
  - Impact: Memory usage increases over time
  - Priority: Medium

### React Hook Dependency Warnings

- [ ] **useEffect missing dependencies** in docs pages
  - Warning: Missing 'doc?.slug' dependency
  - Impact: Stale closures, incorrect re-renders
  - Priority: Medium

- [ ] **useCallback missing dependencies** in file watcher
  - Warning: Missing 'refreshDocs' and 'refreshStructure'
  - Impact: Stale closures, performance issues
  - Priority: Medium

## üêõ UI/UX Issues

### Mobile Responsiveness

- [ ] Kanban board not scrollable on mobile
- [ ] Sidebar doesn't collapse properly on small screens
- [ ] Task cards too small on mobile devices
- [ ] Touch events not working for drag-and-drop

### Dark Mode Issues

- [ ] Some components don't respect dark mode
- [ ] Flash of unstyled content on theme switch
- [ ] Inconsistent colors in some UI elements

### Accessibility Problems

- [ ] Missing ARIA labels on interactive elements
- [ ] Poor keyboard navigation support
- [ ] Insufficient color contrast in some areas
- [ ] Screen reader compatibility issues

## üîß Performance Issues

### File Processing

- [ ] **Large file handling**
  - Issue: UI freezes when processing large markdown files
  - Solution: Implement streaming/chunked processing

- [ ] **Directory scanning performance**
  - Issue: Slow startup with many files
  - Solution: Lazy loading and progressive scanning

### Memory Usage

- [ ] **Store memory leaks**
  - Issue: Zustand stores not cleaning up properly
  - Impact: Memory usage grows over time

- [ ] **Component re-renders**
  - Issue: Unnecessary re-renders causing performance issues
  - Solution: Better memoization and state management

## üèó Build & Development Issues

### Package Size

- [ ] **Large npm package** (21.8 MB)
  - Issue: Package includes unnecessary build artifacts
  - Solution: Better .npmignore configuration

### Development Experience

- [ ] **Slow TypeScript compilation**
  - Issue: Type checking takes too long
  - Solution: Incremental builds and better tsconfig

- [ ] **Hot reload issues**
  - Issue: Changes sometimes don't trigger reload
  - Solution: Better file watching configuration

## üîí Security Issues

### Input Validation

- [ ] **Markdown content sanitization**
  - Issue: User input not properly sanitized
  - Risk: XSS vulnerabilities
  - Priority: High

- [ ] **File path validation**
  - Issue: Insufficient path validation
  - Risk: Directory traversal attacks
  - Priority: High

### Dependencies

- [ ] **Outdated dependencies**
  - Issue: Some dependencies have known vulnerabilities
  - Solution: Regular dependency updates

## üåê Cross-Platform Issues

### Windows Compatibility

- [ ] **Path separator issues**
  - Issue: Unix paths don't work on Windows
  - Solution: Use path.join() consistently

- [ ] **File permissions**
  - Issue: Permission errors on Windows
  - Solution: Better error handling

### Node.js Version Compatibility

- [ ] **Node 16 compatibility**
  - Issue: Some features require Node 18+
  - Solution: Graceful degradation or clear requirements

## üìä Data Integrity Issues

### File Operations

- [ ] **Concurrent file writes**
  - Issue: Race conditions when multiple users edit
  - Solution: File locking or conflict resolution

- [ ] **Metadata corruption**
  - Issue: YAML frontmatter can be corrupted
  - Solution: Better parsing and validation

### State Synchronization

- [ ] **Store desynchronization**
  - Issue: UI state doesn't match file state
  - Solution: Better state management patterns

## üîç Error Handling

### User-Facing Errors

- [ ] **Generic error messages**
  - Issue: Errors don't provide actionable information
  - Solution: Better error categorization and messages

- [ ] **Silent failures**
  - Issue: Some operations fail without user notification
  - Solution: Comprehensive error reporting

### Developer Experience

- [ ] **Poor error logging**
  - Issue: Difficult to debug issues in production
  - Solution: Structured logging with context

## üß™ Testing Issues

### Test Coverage

- [ ] **No unit tests**
  - Issue: No automated testing for core functionality
  - Solution: Implement Jest-based test suite

- [ ] **No E2E tests**
  - Issue: No integration testing
  - Solution: Implement Playwright tests

### Test Infrastructure

- [ ] **No CI/CD pipeline**
  - Issue: No automated testing on PRs
  - Solution: GitHub Actions setup

## üìã Documentation Issues

### Missing Documentation

- [ ] **API documentation incomplete**
  - Issue: Endpoints not documented
  - Solution: Generate API docs from code

- [ ] **Configuration reference missing**
  - Issue: All config options not documented
  - Solution: Comprehensive config guide

### Outdated Information

- [ ] **Installation instructions outdated**
  - Issue: Some steps no longer accurate
  - Solution: Regular documentation review
