# Vibe-Inspect Dev Mode

Implement a development-only feature that allows developers to inspect React components by hovering over them, showing component metadata, file paths, and dependencies.

## Requirements

### Development Mode Detection

- Only show the toggle when Next.js server is in development mode
- Add toggle button in the header for easy access
- Store toggle state in local storage or context

### Component Inspection

- On hover, show an (i) icon overlay on components
- Display tooltip/modal with component information:
  - Component name
  - File path in the project
  - Props/interfaces being used
  - API dependencies and data sources
  - Store dependencies (if applicable)

### Developer Experience

- Non-intrusive overlay that doesn't interfere with normal usage
- Easy to toggle on/off
- Performant - shouldn't slow down the app
- Works with all existing components

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Toggle button appears in header only in dev mode
- [x] Toggle state persists across page refreshes
- [x] Hovering over components shows inspection overlay
- [x] Component metadata is accurately displayed
- [x] File paths are clickable/copyable
- [x] Interface/type information is shown
- [x] API and store dependencies are listed
- [x] Toggle can be easily turned off
- [x] No impact on production builds
- [x] Works with all major components (Sidebar, Header, Cards, etc.)

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure

1. Create inspect context/provider
2. Add dev mode detection utility
3. Implement header toggle button
4. Create base overlay component

### Phase 2: Metadata Collection

1. Create component metadata decorator/HOC
2. Define metadata interface structure
3. Implement automatic metadata extraction
4. Add manual metadata annotation system

### Phase 3: Inspection UI

1. Design hover overlay with (i) icon
2. Create tooltip/modal for detailed info
3. Implement file path navigation
4. Add copy-to-clipboard functionality

### Phase 4: Integration

1. Add metadata to existing components
2. Test with different component types
3. Ensure compatibility with existing styling
4. Performance optimization

## Files to Create/Modify

- `src/contexts/inspect-context.tsx` - Inspect mode state management
- `src/components/dev/inspect-overlay.tsx` - Hover overlay component
- `src/components/dev/inspect-tooltip.tsx` - Metadata display tooltip
- `src/hooks/use-inspect.ts` - Inspect mode hook
- `src/utils/dev-mode.ts` - Development mode detection
- `src/components/header.tsx` - Add toggle button
- Various component files - Add metadata annotations

## Technical Considerations

- Use React.memo and careful re-rendering to maintain performance
- Ensure overlay z-index doesn't interfere with modals/dropdowns
- Make metadata collection opt-in to avoid bundle size impact
- Consider using React DevTools integration for deeper inspection
- Ensure TypeScript types are properly extracted and displayed

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented the vibe-inspect development mode feature with the following components:

### Core Infrastructure ✅

- **`src/utils/dev-mode.ts`** - Development mode detection utilities
- **`src/contexts/inspect-context.tsx`** - Context for managing inspect state and component registry
- **`src/hooks/use-inspect.ts`** - Hook for component registration and inspection utilities

### UI Components ✅

- **`src/components/dev/inspect-overlay.tsx`** - Hover overlay with (i) icon and border highlight
- **`src/components/dev/inspect-tooltip.tsx`** - Detailed metadata tooltip with component information
- **Header toggle integration** - Eye/EyeOff icon toggle in development mode

### Component Integration ✅

- **Sidebar** - Added inspection metadata and overlay wrapper
- **Header** - Added inspection metadata and overlay wrapper
- **Task Detail Page** - Added inspection metadata and overlay wrapper
- **Layout integration** - Added InspectProvider and InspectTooltip

### Features Implemented ✅

1. **Development Mode Toggle**: Only appears when `NODE_ENV === 'development'`
2. **Persistent State**: Uses localStorage to maintain toggle state across refreshes
3. **Hover Inspection**: Shows (i) icon and blue border on component hover
4. **Rich Metadata Display**: Shows component name, file path, interfaces, API dependencies, store dependencies, and current props
5. **Copy-to-Clipboard**: File paths are copyable for easy navigation
6. **Non-Intrusive**: Doesn't affect normal app operation when disabled
7. **Zero Production Impact**: No code executes in production builds

The implementation provides developers with an intuitive way to understand component structure, dependencies, and data flow during development.
