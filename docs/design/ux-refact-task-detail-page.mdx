# Gition Task Detail Page UI/UX Specification

## Introduction

This document defines the user experience goals, information architecture, user flows, and visual design specifications for Gition's **Task Detail Page** user interface. It serves as the foundation for visual design and frontend development, ensuring a cohesive and user-centered experience.

### Overall UX Goals & Principles

#### Target User Personas

**Gition Maintainer:** A developer who wants a zero-config local web interface for Markdown documentation and task management. They prioritize efficiency in managing their local files, and need quick access to task details for editing and updates.

#### Usability Goals

- Ease of learning: New users can complete core tasks within 5 minutes
- Efficiency: Users should be able to quickly find and act on the most important information related to a task with minimal clicks.
- Clarity: The layout should clearly distinguish between different types of information (e.g., task status, description, subtasks, comments) and present them in an easily digestible format.
- Consistency: The design should align with existing Gition UI patterns while incorporating best practices from leading task management tools.
- Intuitiveness: New users should be able to understand how to interact with the Task Detail page without extensive training.

#### Design Principles

1. **Prioritize Core Information:** Ensure the most critical task details (status, title, assignee, due date, description) are immediately visible and prominent, making them **clear, compact, and easy to read** for **eye time effective** scanning.
2. **Contextual Relevance:** Display related information (subtasks, comments, attachments) in a way that is easily accessible but doesn't overwhelm the primary view, promoting a **simple** and **compact** presentation.
3. **Action-Oriented Design:** Make common actions (e.g., changing status, editing description, adding comments) discoverable and easy to perform.
4. **Visual Hierarchy:** Use size, color, and spacing effectively to guide the user's eye and highlight important elements, contributing to an **easy to read** and **eye time effective** interface.
5. **Adaptability:** The design should be flexible enough to accommodate different types of tasks and future enhancements (e.g., custom fields).

### Information Architecture (IA)

#### Site Map / Screen Inventory

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Task Detail Page] --> B[Header (Task Title & Key Actions)]
    A --> C[Core Details (Status, Priority, Assignee, Due Date, Value Score, Estimate Score)]
    A --> D[Description]
    A --> E[Subtasks/Checklist]
    A --> F[Comments/Activity Log]
    A --> G[Attachments]
    A --> H[Related Items (e.g., Parent Epic, Linked Documents, External Links)]
```

#### Navigation Structure

**Primary Navigation:** The main Gition navigation will allow users to switch between "Documentation" and "Tasks" (Kanban board).

**Secondary Navigation (within Tasks):** Users will navigate from the Kanban board or a task list to the Task Detail Page.

**Task Detail Page Navigation:**

- **Back Button:** A clear "Back to Tasks" or "Return to Kanban" button to easily return to the overview.
- **Internal Sections:** Within the Task Detail Page, key sections like "Description," "Subtasks," "Comments," "Attachments," and "Related Items" will be clearly demarcated. These could potentially be tabbed or collapsible sections to maintain compactness.
- **External Links:** `ref:` and `sourceLink` metadata will provide direct links to other tasks, documents, or external resources.

**Relationship to Kanban View:** The Task Detail Page will likely function as a modal or a side panel overlaying the Kanban board for quick, in-context viewing and editing, mimicking best-in-class tools like Trello or Jira's quick edit. This allows users to stay within the flow of the Kanban while accessing detailed information.

**Breadcrumb Strategy:** Simple breadcrumbs could indicate `Tasks > [Current Task Title]` if navigating as a full page. If a modal, the context of the Kanban board is inherently maintained.

### User Flows

#### Viewing Task Details

**User Goal:** The user wants to quickly understand the current status, key information, and overall context of a specific task.

**Entry Points:** Clicking on a task from the Kanban board or a task list.

**Success Criteria:** The user can find all critical information at a glance, and understand the task's current state and relevant details without needing to navigate away or dig deep.

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User Clicks on Task] --> B{Task Detail Page Loads (Modal/Panel)}
    B --> C[Display Task Title]
    B --> D[Display Status, Priority, Assignee, Due Date, Value Score, Estimate Score]
    B --> E[Display Description]
    B --> F[Display Subtasks/Checklist]
    B --> G[Display Comments/Activity Log]
    B --> H[Display Attachments]
    B --> I[Display Related Items (e.g., Parent Epic, Linked Docs, External Links)]
    C & D & E & F & G & H & I --> J[User comprehends task details]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- Task Not Found: Display a clear "Task Not Found" message and allow easy return to the main task view.
- Loading States: Show clear loading indicators while task details are being fetched.

**Notes:** Emphasize rapid display of critical information and smart use of space to avoid clutter. Information should be scannable.

#### Updating Task Status

**User Goal:** The user wants to quickly and easily change the overall status of a task or the completion status of its subtasks, reflecting current progress.

**Entry Points:** The Task Detail page, where task and subtask status indicators are visible.

**Success Criteria:** The user can update a task or subtask status with minimal clicks, and the UI immediately reflects the change.

#### Flow Diagram

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User on Task Detail Page] --> B{Wants to change main Task Status?}
    B -- Yes --> C[Click Task Status Indicator (e.g., Status Badge/Dropdown)]
    C --> D[Select New Status (e.g., Todo, In Progress, Done, Blocked, Waiting, Review)]
    D --> E[System Updates Task Status]
    E --> F[UI Reflects New Status & Updates Kanban/List View]

    B -- No --> G{Wants to change Subtask Status?}
    G -- Yes --> H[Locate Subtask Checkbox]
    H --> I[Click Subtask Checkbox]
    I --> J{Subtask State Toggles}
    J --> J1[From [ ] Todo to [~] In Progress (if applicable)]
    J --> J2[From [~] In Progress to [x] Done]
    J --> J3[From [x] Done to [ ] Todo (reopen)]
    J3 --> K[System Updates Subtask Status]
    K --> L[UI Reflects New Subtask Status]
    L --> M[Update Task Progress Bar/Summary (if applicable)]

    F & M --> N[User Confirms Status Update]
```

**Edge Cases & Error Handling:**

- Invalid Status Change: Provide feedback if a status change is not allowed (e.g., trying to move a blocked task to "Done" without unblocking).
- Concurrent Edits: Handle potential conflicts if multiple users (or agents) try to update the same task simultaneously (future consideration).
- Save Errors: Display clear messages if the update fails to save.

**Notes:** Emphasis on single-click interaction for common status changes. Visual feedback on status updates is crucial.

### Wireframes & Mockups

| Neutral (Background) | \#ffffff              | \#1f2937             | Page backgrounds, card backgrounds          |

#### Typography

##### Font Families

- **Primary:** Inter (or similar clean sans-serif system font for readability)
- **Monospace:** JetBrains Mono / Fira Code (or similar for code blocks and technical notes)

##### Type Scale

| Element            | Size (px) | Weight    | Line Height | Tailwind Class Example |
| ------------------ | --------- | --------- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| H1 (Task Title)    | 28-32     | Bold      | 1.2         | text-3xl font-bold     |
| H2 (Section Title) | 20-24     | Semi-bold | 1.3         | text-xl font-semibold  |
| Body               | 16        | Normal    | 1.5         | text-base              |
| Small              | 14        | Normal    | 1.4         | text-sm                |
| Metadata           | 12        | Normal    | 1.4         | text-xs uppercase      |

#### Iconography

**Icon Library:** Lucide Icons (integrates well with Shadcn UI, modern, flexible)

**Usage Guidelines:**

- Use icons sparingly to enhance meaning, not to replace text.
- Ensure icons are recognizable and consistent in style.
- Provide clear labels or tooltips for all interactive icons.
- Icons should scale appropriately with text size.

#### Spacing & Layout

**Grid System:** Utilize a flexible, responsive grid system (Tailwind's default grid and flexbox utilities). Focus on content alignment and consistent gutters.

**Spacing Scale:** Leverage Tailwind CSS's default spacing scale (e.g., `space-x-`, `p-`, `m-`). Prioritize consistent vertical rhythm and adequate breathing room around elements to maintain compactness without feeling cramped. Default to smaller spacing units to achieve a "compact" feel.

### Accessibility Requirements

This section defines specific accessibility requirements based on target compliance level and user needs. Be comprehensive but practical.

#### Compliance Target

**Standard:** WCAG 2.1 AA (A common, achievable standard for broad accessibility).

#### Key Requirements

**Visual:**

- Color contrast ratios: Ensure all text and interactive elements meet WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios (at least 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large text).
- Focus indicators: Provide clear, visible focus indicators for all interactive elements (buttons, links, form fields) for keyboard navigation.
- Text sizing: Users must be able to resize text up to 200% without loss of content or functionality.

**Interaction:**

- Keyboard navigation: All interactive elements must be reachable and operable via keyboard alone, following a logical tab order.
- Screen reader support: Implement proper ARIA attributes and semantic HTML to ensure meaningful experience for screen reader users. Labels, roles, and states must be conveyed accurately.
- Touch targets: Ensure interactive elements have a minimum touch target size of 44x44 CSS pixels for touch devices.

**Content:**

- Alternative text: All non-text content (images, icons conveying meaning) must have appropriate `alt` text.
- Heading structure: Use a logical and hierarchical heading structure (`<h1>` to `<h6>`) for clear document outline.
- Form labels: All form inputs must have associated, programmatically determinable labels.

#### Testing Strategy

**Accessibility Testing:** Conduct automated accessibility checks (e.g., Lighthouse, Axe DevTools) during development. Perform manual keyboard navigation and screen reader testing (e.g., VoiceOver, NVDA) for critical user flows.

### Responsiveness Strategy

This section defines breakpoints and adaptation strategies for different device sizes. Consider both technical constraints and user contexts.

#### Breakpoints

| Breakpoint | Min Width | Max Width | Target Devices                                |
| ---------- | --------- | --------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Mobile     | 0px       | 639px     | Smartphones (Portrait & Landscape)            |
| Tablet     | 640px     | 1023px    | Tablets (Portrait & Landscape), Small Laptops |
| Desktop    | 1024px    | 1279px    | Standard Desktop Monitors                     |
| Wide       | 1280px    | -         | Large Desktop Monitors, Ultrawide Displays    |

#### Adaptation Patterns

**Layout Changes:**

- **Mobile:** Task details will likely stack vertically, with secondary sections (comments, attachments) potentially hidden behind accordions or tabs for compactness.
- **Tablet:** A two-column layout might be introduced, or key sections could remain stacked but with more horizontal space.
- **Desktop/Wide:** A multi-column layout with primary details on one side and supporting information (comments, subtasks) on the other.

**Navigation Changes:**

- **Mobile:** Primary navigation may collapse into a hamburger menu. Task Detail page might become a full-screen view rather than a modal/side panel.
- **Desktop:** Clear sidebars or top-level navigation elements for switching between tasks/docs and the Task Detail view.

**Content Priority:**

- **Mobile First:** Ensure critical task data (title, status, assignee, due date, description) is always prioritized and easily scannable on smaller screens.
- **Progressive Enhancement:** Gradually reveal more information and layout complexity as screen real estate increases.

**Interaction Changes:**

- **Touch vs. Click:** Ensure large enough touch targets for mobile. Desktop interactions will primarily use mouse/keyboard.
- **Hover States:** Utilize hover states on desktop for discoverability of actions, but ensure alternatives for touch devices.

### Animation & Micro-interactions

This section defines motion design principles and key interactions. Keep performance and accessibility in mind.

#### Motion Principles

- **Purposeful:** Animations should serve a clear purpose (e.g., provide feedback, guide attention, indicate state change), not just for decoration.
- **Subtle & Fast:** Prioritize subtle, quick animations that enhance the experience without delaying user interaction or causing distraction.
- **Consistent:** Apply similar animation styles for similar interactions across the application.
- **Performant:** Ensure animations run smoothly at 60fps on target devices, avoiding jank.

#### Key Animations

- **Task Status Change:** Subtle transition (e.g., color fade, quick checkmark animation) when status is updated. (Duration: 150ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Subtask Completion:** Checkbox animation and subtle strikethrough/fade on text upon completion. (Duration: 100ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Collapsible Section Toggle:** Smooth expand/collapse animation for sections like "Subtasks" or "Comments." (Duration: 200ms, Easing: ease-in-out)
- **Modal/Panel Open/Close:** Fade and scale/slide animation for the Task Detail modal/side panel. (Duration: 300ms, Easing: ease-out)
- **Form Field Validation:** Gentle shake or border highlight for invalid input. (Duration: 250ms, Easing: ease-out)

### Performance Considerations

This section defines performance goals and strategies that impact UX design decisions.

#### Performance Goals

- **Page Load:** Initial Task Detail page content (excluding comments/attachments if lazy loaded) should load within 1.5 seconds on a fast 3G network.
- **Interaction Response:** User interactions (e.g., clicking a button, updating status) should result in visual feedback within 100ms.
- **Animation FPS:** All animations should run at a consistent 60 frames per second (FPS).

#### Design Strategies

- **Lazy Loading:** Implement lazy loading for less critical content (e.g., extensive comment history, large attachments) to prioritize core task details.
- **Optimized Assets:** Ensure all images, icons, and other media are optimized for web (e.g., compressed, responsive image formats).
- **Efficient CSS:** Leverage Tailwind CSS's JIT mode and purge unused styles to keep CSS bundle size minimal.
- **Minimal DOM Complexity:** Design with efficient HTML structure to reduce rendering time.
- **Client-Side Rendering Optimization:** Optimize data fetching and state updates to minimize re-renders.
