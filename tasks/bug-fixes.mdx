# Bug Fixes & Technical Issues

Critical bugs and technical issues that need immediate attention.

## üö® Critical Bugs

### TypeScript Compilation Errors

- [x] **chokidar namespace error** in `src/app/api/files/watch/route.ts`
  - ‚úÖ FIXED: Proper ESM import `import chokidar, { FSWatcher } from "chokidar";`
  - Impact: File watching functionality works correctly
  - Fixed in: Latest codebase

- [x] **Store type inconsistencies** in task management
  - ‚úÖ FIXED: Proper TypeScript interfaces with legacy exports for backward compatibility
  - Impact: Type safety maintained with `Task as TaskGroup` exports
  - Fixed in: Latest codebase

- [ ] **Missing properties in DocsStore**
  - Status: PARTIALLY FIXED - Store has `getDocBySlug` and `fetchDocs` but no individual `doc`/`fetchDoc`
  - Current: Uses `getDocBySlug(slug)` pattern instead of individual doc properties
  - Impact: Documentation pages work correctly with current pattern
