## 📝 Code Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use strict mode (`"strict": true`)
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance
- Use proper dependency arrays in `useEffect`
- Keep components focused and single-purpose

### Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS for styling
- Follow existing class patterns
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Ensure responsive design

### File Organization
```

├── app/                 # Next.js app router
├── components/          # Reusable components
