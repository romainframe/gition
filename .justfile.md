# Justfile Documentation

This project uses [just](https://github.com/casey/just) as a command runner to simplify common development tasks.

## Installation

```

### Testing

```bash
# Test the CLI locally
just test-cli

# Test CLI with specific directory
just test-cli-dir ./docs

# Initialize a test project
just test-init
```

### Git Workflow

```bash
# Create a new feature branch
just feature my-new-feature

# Check git status
just status

# Add all files and commit
just commit "Add new feature"

# Push to remote
just push

# Switch back to main
just main
```

### Release Workflow

```bash
# Dry run publish to check what will be published
just publish-dry

# Create a patch release (0.1.4 -> 0.1.5)
just release-patch

# Create a minor release (0.1.4 -> 0.2.0)
just release-minor

# Or manually bump and publish
just bump-patch
just publish
```

### Maintenance

just clean

# Fresh install (clean + reinstall)
just fresh

# Update dependencies

# Check for outdated dependencies
just outdated

# Reset everything (clean + remove lockfile + reinstall)
just reset
```

### CI/CD Simulation

```bash
# Run full CI simulation locally
just ci

# Run pre-commit checks
just precommit

# Verify build works
just verify
```

## Advanced Commands

### Development Tools

```bash
# Run development with debug output
just debug

# Watch TypeScript compilation
just typecheck-watch

# Watch and rebuild on changes
just watch

# Analyze bundle size
just analyze

# Open project in VS Code
just code
```

### Package Management

```bash
# Run a specific npm script
just run <script-name>

# Generate changelog
just changelog

# Format check without fixing
just format-check
```

## Customization

You can extend the justfile by adding new recipes. The syntax is simple:

```just
# My custom command
my-command:
  echo "Hello from my custom command!"
  pnpm custom-script

# Command with parameters
deploy environment:
  echo "Deploying to {{environment}}"
  NODE_ENV={{environment}} pnpm build
```

## Tips

1. Use `just` without arguments to see all available commands
2. Use `just help` for a quick reference of common tasks
3. Commands are grouped logically (development, git, release, etc.)
4. Most commands use pnpm but will fall back to npm if needed
5. Git commands are shortcuts for common workflows
6. Release commands handle version bumping and publishing automatically

## Troubleshooting

### Just not found

Make sure just is installed and in your PATH:

```bash
which just
just --version
```

### Commands failing

Check that you're in the project root directory and dependencies are installed:

```bash
pwd  # Should be in gition project root
just install
```

### Permission issues

Some commands may need additional permissions (especially git commands):

```bash
# Make sure git is configured
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```
