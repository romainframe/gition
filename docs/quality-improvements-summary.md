# Quality Improvements Summary

This document summarizes the quality improvements implemented as part of the development priorities.

## Testing Infrastructure ✅

### Jest Setup (Unit Testing)

- Installed and configured Jest with TypeScript support
- Added React Testing Library for component testing
- Created `jest.config.js` and `jest.setup.js` for proper configuration
- Set up coverage thresholds (70% for all metrics)

### Playwright Setup (E2E Testing)

- Playwright was already configured
- Added accessibility testing with @axe-core/playwright

### Test Fixtures and Sample Data

Created comprehensive test fixtures:

- `/src/__fixtures__/tasks.ts` - Mock task data
- `/src/__fixtures__/mdx-content.ts` - Sample MDX file content
- `/src/__fixtures__/test-utils.tsx` - Testing utilities and custom render functions

## GitHub Actions CI/CD Pipeline ✅

Created two workflow files:

### `.github/workflows/ci.yml`

- **Lint job**: Runs ESLint and Prettier checks
- **Test job**: Runs unit tests with coverage reporting
- **E2E job**: Runs Playwright tests
- **Build job**: Verifies the project builds successfully

### `.github/workflows/release.yml`

- Automated release process for NPM publishing
- Triggers on version tags
- Creates GitHub releases with auto-generated notes

## Code Coverage Reporting ✅

- Configured Jest to generate coverage reports
- Added Codecov integration in CI pipeline
- Created `.github/codecov.yml` for coverage configuration
- Coverage reports in text, lcov, and HTML formats

## Code Quality Improvements ✅

### ESLint Warnings

- All ESLint warnings have been resolved
- Project passes linting with no errors

### Error Handling System

Created comprehensive error handling:

- `/src/lib/errors.ts` - Custom error classes and utilities
- `/src/components/error-boundary.tsx` - React error boundary component
- `/src/app/error.tsx` - Next.js error page
- `/src/app/global-error.tsx` - Global error handler
- `/src/middleware/error-handler.ts` - API error handling middleware

### Logging System

Implemented structured logging:

- `/src/lib/logger.ts` - Logger singleton with different log levels
- Performance logging utilities
- Request/response logging helpers
- Business event logging

### Input Validation and Sanitization

- Installed Zod for schema validation
- Created `/src/lib/validation.ts` with:
  - Task validation schemas
  - API request validation
  - HTML/Markdown sanitization functions
  - File path validation

## Unit Tests Created

   - Snapshot tests for visual regression

2. **Theme Toggle Test** (`/src/components/__tests__/theme-toggle.test.tsx`)
   - Theme switching functionality
   - Mounting behavior
   - Accessibility labels

3. **Validation Tests** (`/src/lib/__tests__/validation.test.ts`)
   - Schema validation
   - Sanitization functions
   - Error message formatting

4. **Error Handling Tests** (`/src/lib/__tests__/errors.test.ts`)
   - All error classes
   - Type guards
   - Error handler utility

5. **Utils Tests** (`/src/lib/__tests__/utils.test.ts`)
   - cn() utility function
   - Class merging behavior

## E2E Tests Created

1. **Navigation Tests** (`/tests/navigation.spec.ts`)
   - Page navigation
   - Back/forward functionality
   - Active link states

2. **Theme Toggle Tests** (`/tests/theme-toggle.spec.ts`)
   - Theme switching
   - Persistence across reloads
   - Icon visibility

3. **Task Management Tests** (`/tests/task-management.spec.ts`)
   - Task list display
   - Filtering and search
   - Subtask completion
   - Task detail navigation

4. **Accessibility Tests** (`/tests/accessibility.spec.ts`)
   - Automated accessibility scans
   - Keyboard navigation
   - ARIA labels and heading hierarchy
   - Color contrast validation

## Commands Updated

Added new test commands to `package.json`:

- `pnpm test` - Run unit tests
- `pnpm test:watch` - Run tests in watch mode
- `pnpm test:coverage` - Run tests with coverage
- `pnpm test:e2e` - Run Playwright E2E tests
- `pnpm test:e2e:ui` - Run Playwright with UI mode
- `pnpm test:e2e:headed` - Run Playwright in headed mode
- `pnpm test:e2e:debug` - Debug Playwright tests

## Next Steps

With the quality improvements completed, the codebase now has:

- ✅ Comprehensive testing infrastructure
- ✅ CI/CD automation
- ✅ Error handling and logging
- ✅ Input validation and sanitization
- ✅ Code coverage reporting

All tests are passing and the project builds successfully!
